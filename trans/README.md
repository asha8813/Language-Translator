\# 🗣️ Real-Time Speech-to-Text Language Translator



The \*\*Real-Time Speech-to-Text Language Translator\*\* is a Python-based application that listens to speech through a microphone, converts it into text, translates it into another language, and optionally speaks out the translated output — all in real time.
